      <h2>Early Years</h2>

      <h3>Controversial Birth Date</h3>
      <p> Beethoven (the third of his family) was born to Maria Magdalena Keverich and Johann van Beethoven in the city
         of Bonn in the Electorate of Cologne, a principality of the Holy Roman Empire. Although his exact date of birth
         is uncertain on documents, Beethoven was baptized on December 17, 1770.

         Based on law and custom, babies at that time were baptized within 24 hours of birth. Beethoven himself believed
         that he was born in 1772, and he stubbornly insisted on the incorrect date even when presented with official
         papers that proved beyond any reasonable doubt that 1770 was his true birth year. So, December 16 is his most
         likely birthdate.</p>

         <hr>
      <h2>Family Life</h2>
      <p> He had seven siblings, of which, only three survived through infancy, and only two survived into adulthood.
         Beethoven's mother was a slender, genteel, and deeply moralistic woman. His father (and first piano teacher)
         was a mediocre court singer better known for his alcoholism than any musical ability. However, Beethoven's
         grandfather, Kapellmeister Ludwig van Beethoven, was Bonn's most prosperous and eminent musician, and a source
         of endless pride for young Beethoven.</p>

      <h3>Abuse</h3>
      <p> Beethoven's father began teaching him music at a young age with extreme rigor and brutality in hopes that he
         would be seen as a child prodigy by Wolfgang Mozart. He practiced the violin and clavier with his father and
         took additional lessons from different organists around town.</p>

      <aside>On an almost daily basis, in order to learn and practice, Beethoven was beaten, locked in a room, and sleep
         deprived.
         This abuse affected him negatively for the rest of his life.</aside>

   <h2>The Start of Recognition</h2>

   <h3>Education</h3>
   <p>At age seven, Beethoven's father arranged his first public performance in March 1778. He was presented as a
      "little son of 6 years," (Mozart's age when he debuted for Empress Maria Theresia) when he was in fact seven years
      old. He played impressively, but his recital never received any press. Struggling with sums and spelling his whole
      life, he stated that "Music comes to me more readily than words." In 1781, at the age of 10, he dropped out of
      school to study music full time with Christian Gottlob Neefe. At the age of 12, he published his first
      composition, a set of piano variations on a theme by an obscure classical composer named Dressler.</p>
   <hr>
   <h3>Mozart</h3>
   <p>By 1784, Beethoven's father was no longer able to support his family due to his worsening alcoholism and voice
      decay. So, Beethoven formally requested an official appointment as Assistant Court Organist. Although he was
      young, his request was accepted, and he was put on the court payroll with a modest annual salary. To help him with
      his musical development, the court send him to Vienna in 1787 in hopes of being able to study with Mozart. After
      just a few weeks, he had to return to Bonn to be with his ailing mother. While there, he continued to improve his
      reputation as the city's most promising young court musician.</p>
   <blockquote> *Only speculation and inconclusive evidence exists that he ever met with Mozart, let alone studied with
      him.</blockquote>
   <hr>
   <h3>Early Career</h3>
   <p>In 1792, Beethoven decided to move back to Vienna once again. Mozart had passed away a year earlier, and Joseph
      Haydn was now the unquestioned greatest composer alive. While in Vienna, he studied directly with Haydn and other
      eminent musicians and dedicated himself wholeheartedly to musical study. Finally, Beethoven made his long-awaited
      public debut in Vienna on March 29, 1795, playing his "first" piano concerto in C Major. Shortly after that, he
      decided to publish a series of three piano trios as his Opus 1, which brought him great acclaim and financial
      success. He continued to compose piece after piece over the years and mastered the Viennese forms developed by
      Mozart and Hadyn labeling him as a masterful composer. This is around the time he started to lose his hearing,
      most likely due contracting typhus in 1796.</p>

   <h2>Personal Life and Death</h2>
   <h3>Life and Death after Recognition</h3>
   <p>Beethoven never married or had children probably due to his shyness and lack of good looks. He was involved in an
      ugly legal battle with his sister-in-law after his brother's death that lasted for seven years with him winning
      legal custody of his nephew. He lived a lonely and miserable life even though he created such beautiful music. He
      was paranoid, greedy, short tempered, and absent minded often feuding with his family, pupils, patrons, and
      friends. Beethoven died on March 26, 1827 (age 56) due to cirrhosis of the liver.
