        <dd>There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his baptism, in
            the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at
            the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which
            Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.</dd>

        <dt id="2">Death</dt>
        <dd>Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner and a
            "Frau van Beethoven" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to
            Hüttenbrenner, at about 5 pm there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: "Beethoven opened
            his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched ... not
            another breath, not a heartbeat more." Many visitors came to the death-bed; some locks of the
            dead man's hair were retained by Hüttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.</dd>

        <dt id="3">Cause of Death</dt>
        <dd>On his return journey to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck
            Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December
            noticed symptoms including fever, jaundice and dropsy, with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing
            difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from Beethoven's
            abdomen. An autopsy revealed Beethoven had significant liver damage, which may have been due to his
            heavy alcohol consumption, and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.</dd>

        <dt id="4">Cut Off His Ear?</dt>
        <dd>Many inaccurately confuse Beethoven with painter Van Gogh and think that Beethoven cut off
            his own ear. That is not true, Beethoven did not cut his ear, but Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh
            did.</dd>

        <dt id="5">Marriage</dt>
        <dd>While he was at Teplitz in 1812 he wrote a ten-page love letter to his "Immortal Beloved",
            which he never sent to its addressee. The identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of
            debate, although the musicologist Maynard Solomon has convincingly demonstrated that the intended
            recipient must have been Antonie Brentano; other candidates have included Julie Guicciardi, Therese
            Malfatti and Josephine Brunsvik.</dd>

        <dd>All of these had been regarded by Beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in Vienna.
            Guicciardi, although she flirted with Beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married
            Wenzel Robert von Gallenberg in November 1803. (Beethoven insisted to his later secretary and
            biographer, Anton Schindler, that Gucciardi had "sought me out, crying, but I scorned her".)
            Josephine had, since Beethoven's initial infatuation with her, married the elderly Count Joseph
            Deym, who died in 1804. Beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence.
            Initially, he accepted that Josephine could not love him, but he continued to address himself to her
            even after she had moved to Budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last
            letter to her of 1807: "I thank you for wishing still to appear as if I were not altogether banished
            from your memory". Malfatti was the niece of Beethoven's doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810.
            He was 40, she was 19, the proposal was rejected. She is now remembered as the recipient of the
            piano bagatelle Für Elise.</dd>

        <dd>Antonie (Toni) Brentano (née von Birkenstock), ten years younger than Beethoven, was the wife of
            Franz Brentano, the half-brother of Bettina Brentano, who provided Beethoven's introduction to the
            family. It would seem that Antonie and Beethoven had an affair during 1811 to 1812. Antonie left
            Vienna
            with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) Beethoven again,
            although in her later years she wrote and spoke fondly of him. Some speculate that Beethoven was
            the father of Antonie's son Karl Josef, though the two never met.</dd>

        <dd>After 1812 there are no reports of any romantic liaisons of Beethoven; it is, however, clear from
            his correspondence of the period and, later, from the conversation books, that he would occasionally
            meet with prostitutes.</dd>

        <dd>The illness and eventual death of his brother Kaspar from tuberculosis became an increasing
            concern. Kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 Beethoven lent him 1500 florins, to procure the
            repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures. After Kaspar died on 15
            November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's
            wife Johanna over custody of their son Karl, then nine years old. Beethoven had successfully applied
            to Kaspar to have himself named the sole guardian of the boy. A late codicil to Kaspar's will gave
            him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed
            from her custody in January 1816, and had him removed to a private school in 1818 he was again
            preoccupied with the legal processes around Karl. While giving evidence to the court for the
            nobility, the Landrechte, Beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a
            consequence, on 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the civil magistrate of Vienna, where
            he lost sole guardianship. He only regained custody after intensive legal struggles in
            1820. During the years that followed, Beethoven frequently interfered in his nephew's life in
            what Karl perceived as an overbearing manner.</dd>

        <dt id="7">Mozart</dt>
        <dd>In the period 1785 to 1790 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a
            composer.
            This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to
            ongoing problems in the Beethoven family. His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven's
            first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met Mozart.</dd>

        <dd>The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, marked Quasi una fantasia, Op. 27, No. 2, is a
            piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his pupil
            Countess Giulietta Guicciardi. The popular name Moonlight Sonata goes back to a critic's remark
            after Beethoven's death.</dd>

        <dd>The piece is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions for the piano, and it was a popular
            favourite even in his own day. Beethoven wrote the Moonlight Sonata in his early thirties, after
            he had finished with some commissioned work; there is no evidence that he was commissioned to write
            this sonata.</dd>
